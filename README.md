A self-initiated **React Native** mobile app project, developed with full ownership of architecture and code decisions, in collaboration with AI for design and implementation improvements.

## Project Overview

This project showcases how I design and structure the core navigation
and startup experience of a mobile app.

- Clean and predictable navigation structure
- Clear separation between app initialization and navigation flow
- A solid UI and navigation foundation for a music-focused mobile app

## Features

- **Controlled splash screen** with explicit app initialization logic
- **Track list and playback flow** with predictable playback state transitions
- **Random playback logic** across the full music library
- **Favorites screen** for saving and managing user-selected tracks
