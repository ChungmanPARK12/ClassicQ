![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea6ba522-58e8-4d9d-8354-5ce60532dd69)

My first self-initiated project built with React Native + Expo mobile app, developed through AI-assisted planning, design, and implementation, with full ownership of architectural and code decisions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I structure and implement a mobile app flow using React Native.

It focuses on the app’s initial user experience:

**Splash → Home → Loader → Playlist / Track List / Favorites**

The focus is on:

- Clean and predictable navigation structure
- Controlled loading and splash screen behavior
- A calm, distraction-free UX inspired by classical music listening

This repository is part of my portfolio and highlights:

- A solid UI and navigation foundation for a music-focused mobile app.
- A scalable structure prepared for future features such as expanded playlist logic and content management.


## Features

- Splash screen with controlled app initialization.
- Track list with basic playback flow.
- Random playback across the full music library.
- Favorites screen for saved tracks.
- Clean and predictable navigation structure.
