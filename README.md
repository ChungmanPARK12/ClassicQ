![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea6ba522-58e8-4d9d-8354-5ce60532dd69)

A self-initiated React Native mobile app project, developed with full
ownership of architecture and code decisions.

## Project Overview

This project showcases how I design and structure the core navigation
and startup experience of a mobile app.

The focus is on:

- Clean and predictable navigation structure.
- Controlled loading and splash screen behavior.
- A calm, distraction-free UX inspired by classical music listening.
- Screen-specific logic that goes beyond simple UI transitions.

This repository is part of my portfolio and highlights:

- A solid UI and navigation foundation for a music-focused mobile app.
- A scalable structure prepared for future features such as expanded playlist logic and content management.

## Features

- **Controlled splash screen** with explicit app initialization handling.
- **Track list and playback flow** designed for predictable state transitions.
- **Random playback logic** across the full music library.
- **Favorites screen** for persisting user-selected tracks.
- A **clean and consistent navigation structure** across all screens.
